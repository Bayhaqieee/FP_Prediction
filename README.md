## Features
This System will be creating a parameter based on: 

- **Player Details**: The dataset includes detailed information about players such as **name**, **nationality**, **primary and secondary positions**, and their respective **squad** and **competition** participation.  
- **Demographics**: Contains **age** and **birth year** of the players for understanding player lifecycle trends.  
- **Match Participation**: Tracks metrics like **matches played (MP)**, **starting appearances (Starts)**, and **total 90-minute equivalents (90s)**.  
- **Goal Contributions**: Details **goals (Gls)**, **assists (Ast)**, **goals + assists (G+A)**, and **penalty-related stats** such as **penalty goals (PK)** and **penalty attempts (PKatt)**.  
- **Disciplinary Records**: Captures **yellow cards (CrdY)** and **red cards (CrdR)** to evaluate player discipline.  
- **Expected Goals (xG)**: Includes advanced metrics like **expected goals (xG)**, **non-penalty xG (npxG)**, **expected assists (xAG)**, and their combinations like **npxG+xAG**.  
- **Progression Metrics**: Measures player progression abilities via **progressive carries (PrgC)**, **progressive passes (PrgP)**, and **progressive receptions (PrgR)**.  
- **Defensive Metrics**: Tracks **tackles (Tkl)**, **tackles won (TklW)**, **blocks**, **interceptions (Int)**, and **clearances (Clr)** to assess defensive contributions.  
- **Passing Metrics**: Includes **short**, **medium**, and **long pass completion rates (Cmp%)**, along with **progressive passing distances** for evaluating playmaking.  
- **Shooting Metrics**: Captures **shots (Sh)**, **shots on target (SoT)**, and **shot quality metrics (xG, G-xG)** for offensive analysis.  
- **Goalkeeping Metrics**: For goalkeepers, tracks **post-shot expected goals (PSxG)**, **saves**, **errors leading to goals (Err)**, and **clean sheets (GA)**.  
- **Dribbling and Carrying**: Measures **successful dribbles (Succ)**, **carries**, **carry progressions**, and possession loss metrics.  
- **Chance Creation Metrics**: Tracks **shot-creating actions (SCA)** and **goal-creating actions (GCA)** for identifying playmakers.  
- **Touches and Zones**: Details touches in **defensive penalty area**, **attacking penalty area**, and total **live-ball touches**.  
- **Set-Pieces and Fouls**: Includes data on **free kicks (FK)**, **corners (CK)**, **fouls committed and suffered (Fld)**.  
- **Offensive Impact**: Tracks metrics like **key passes (KP)**, **passes into the attacking third**, and **penalty area actions (PPA)**.  
- **Game Time**: Details **minutes played**, **percentage of game time (%MP)**, and **minutes per start or substitute appearance**.  
- **On/Off Impact**: Evaluates team performance with the player on or off the field using metrics like **on-field goals (onG)**, **goals against (onGA)**, and their differences (+/-).  
- **Performance Consistency**: Tracks substitutions, un-subbed matches, and **points per match (PPM)** to gauge reliability.  
- **Advanced Metrics**: Includes calculated statistics such as **expected goal contribution differences (xG+/-)** and **progression metrics per 90 minutes** for deeper insights.
